//! Pijama's type-checker.
//!
//! This module contains all the functions and types required to do type-checking over the MIR of a
//! program. Pijama uses constraint-based typing, which is better suited for type
//! reconstruction/inference than a regular in-place enforcement of the typing rules.
//!
//! The entry-point for this module is the `ty_check` method which does the type checking of a
//! whole program. However, most of the heavy lifting is done by the `Context` and `Unifier` types.
